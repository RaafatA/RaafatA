Advances in high-throughput technologies have led to an intensive accumulation of biological omics data. Each type of omics data has its own characteristics, distribution, and errors associated with the technology, tissue source, and the instrument itself. Therefore, we need to develop robust methods to handle this vast data resource to accelerate progress in various biological fields. 

An eager young mind and researcher interested in molecular plant biology and breeding.
My own research interest lies in applying machine learning to integrate multi-omics data in order to simulate and predict complex traits in molecular plant breeding, including, but not limited to, genotype-to-phenotype prediction and genome simulation of plants.

 I'm always interested in connecting with others in the field and exploring new opportunities to leverage machine learning for a more sustainable future.
